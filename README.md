# CloneAI

This is a program which can digitally "clone" you or your friends voice and personality. The inspiration for this project came after my two best friends and I decided to record all of our voice conversations through Discord over the span of a year. Having GBs of audio data, I thought of possible applications I could target and one of them was the creation of voice clones of ourselves. Some further enhancements were to add real time (online) processing so that we could interact with these voice clones via Discord, Large Language Model (LLM) support so we could ask questions to these clones, and fine-tuning personality of the LLM so that it responds with our personality
